Jira Maven Plugin
=

This Maven plugin allows the manipulation of Atlassian Jira project fixVersions within the project associated with the built component.

**This Maven plugin makes use of Atlassian's Jira REST client libraries. These libraries only support Java versions greater than Java 8; therefore this plugin also only supports Java 8 and beyond.**

**_Documentation concerning this plugin has now moved to the [project wiki](https://github.com/schrepfler/jira-maven-plugin/wiki)._**
